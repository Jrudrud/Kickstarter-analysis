_**An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.**_

_OBJECTIVE:_

  The purpose of this analysis is to help my client decide how, when, and where she should launch her new theatre project. Piecing togethert raw data based on Kickstarter Campaigns, I was able to put together some findings that can give my client insight as to exactly how to launch the project successfully. Two datapoints really stood out: Theatre Outcomes Based on Launch Date, and Outcomes Based on Goals.
  

_ANALYSIS OF CHALLENGES:_

 The most challenging part of analyzing this data was developing the code to figure out the Outcomes Based on Goals. I would caution future analysts to fikter the data properly on the main Kickstarter Sheet to ensure accurate numbers/percentages for successful/failed/canceled campaigns. 
  
 _RESULTS:_
  
 Two key findings I nopticed when looking at the Theatre Outcomes Based on Launch Date are: 
   
     1). Most successful playS will debut between the months of April-July.
     2). The largest percentage of failed plays ranges from October-January.

One key finding I found while looking through Outcomes Based on Goals:
   
      1). The most successful campaigns will range from $35,000-$45,0000.
      
      
 **Outcomes Based on Goals:**

While the dataset is very in depth, there are some limitations. Future additions to the dataset should include plays specifics (i.e. content, length, etc..). Graphs can be made to help visually display the data by separating the future datapoints into genres (e.g. Comedy, Tragedy, Love-story, and Thriller).
