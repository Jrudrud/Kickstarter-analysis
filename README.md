_**# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.**_

_OBJECTIVE:_

  The purpose of this analysis is to help my client decide how, when, and where she should launch her new theatre project. Piecing togethert raw data based on Kickstarter Campaigns, I was able to put together some findings that can give my client insight as to exactly how to launch the project successfully. Two datapoints really stood out: Theatre Outcomes Based on Launch Date, and Outcomes Based on Goals.

_ANALYSIS OF CHALLENGES:_

  Trying to make sense of this data was quite challenging. I wanted to give my client accurate information, so I started by parsing through all of the different Kickstarter campaigns. 
  
  
 _RESULTS:_
  
  Two key findings I nopticed when looking at the Theatre Outcomes Based on Launch Date are: 
    1). The most successful play will debut between the months of April-July.
    2). The largest percentage of failed plays ranges from October-January.
