_**# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.**_

_OBJECTIVE:_

The purpose of this analysis is to help my client decide how, when, and where she should launch her new theatre project. Piecing togethert raw data based on Kickstarter Campaigns, I was able to put together some findings that can give my client insight as to exactly how to launch the project successfully. Two datapoints really stood out: Theatre Outcomes Based on Launch Date, and Outcomes Based on Goals.
